# Capybara Vibe Coding

**The AI-powered coding assistant that thinks, plans, and acts in real-time.**

Capybara Vibe Coding is a next-generation CLI agent designed for complex coding tasks. It combines powerful LLM capabilities with a **visual, immersive dashboard** that keeps you in the loop while it works.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🖥️ Immersive Split-View UI
Experience a true "mission control" interface. When the agent gets to work, the terminal splits into two live zones:
- **Left Panel (Strategic Plan)**: A persistent Todo list showing exactly what the agent plans to do, what's in progress, and what's done.
- **Right Panel (Tactical Execution)**: A real-time feed of the tools the agent is running (e.g., `searching code`, `editing files`, `running tests`).

### 📝 Proactive Task Management
Capybara doesn't just flail around. It uses a built-in **Todo System** to:
1.  **Break down** your complex requests into step-by-step plans.
2.  **Track progress** statefully across the session.
3.  **Self-correct** by adding new tasks as it discovers requirements.

### 🛡️ Safety & Precision
- **Smart Editing**: Uses `search_replace` with strict block matching (no more " hallucinated" line numbers).
- **Directory Guard**: Prevents accidental operations in sensitive paths (like root or home).
- **Permission Control**: Configure tools to `always`, `ask`, or `never` run.

### 🧠 Context Intelligence
- **Deep Awareness**: Automatically scans your project structure, `README.md`, and Git status on startup.
- **OS/Shell adaptation**: Knows if you're on Mac/Zsh or Windows/PowerShell and adapts commands accordingly.

### 🤝 Multi-Agent Delegation
- **Parallel Work**: Spawn specialized child agents for independent subtasks
- **Live Progress**: See real-time updates from child agents in parent console
- **Isolated Context**: Child agents work with focused task descriptions, no shared history
- **Smart Restrictions**: Child agents cannot delegate further or modify todo lists

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Initialize
Create the default configuration at `~/.capybara/config.yaml`:

```bash
capybara init
```

### 3. Start Coding
Launch the interactive session:

```bash
capybara chat
```

## 🛡️ Operation Modes

Capybara supports different modes to suit your workflow:

```bash
# Standard mode (uses config.yaml default permissions)
capybara chat

# Plan Mode: Safe for research/planning. Disables file writes and bash.
capybara chat --mode plan

# Safe Mode: Paranoia mode. Asks for permission before EVERY dangerous action.
capybara chat --mode safe

# Autonomous Mode: Never asks for permission. For trusted environments only.
capybara chat --mode auto
```

## 🖥️ Immersive Split-View UI
**Try a complex task to see the UI in action:**
> "Refactor the src/core/auth.py module to use class-based architecture and add 3 unit tests."

Watch as Capybara:
1.  Creates a Todo list (appearing on the left).
2.  Starts executing tools (appearing on the right).
3.  Checks off items as it completes them.

## 🛠️ Built-in Capabilities

Capybara comes equipped with a versatile tool belt:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`todo`** | Manage task lists (Plan, Track, Update). |
| **`search_replace`** | Safe, block-based file editing. |
| **`bash`** | Execute shell commands (with timeouts). |
| **`list_directory`** | Explore file structures recursively. |
| **`read_file`** | Read file contents. |
| **`grep`** | Search text patterns in codebases. |

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize your agent in `~/.capybara/config.yaml`:

### Model Management
Quickly check or switch models from the CLI:

```bash
# Check current model
capybara model

# Switch to a different model (updates config.yaml)
capybara model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
capybara model gpt-4o
```

```yaml
providers:
  - name: openai
    model: gpt-4o

memory:
  max_tokens: 100000

tools:
  bash_enabled: true
  search_replace_enabled: true
  
  # Security Policies
  security:
    bash:
      permission: ask  # Always ask before running shell commands
    write_file:
      permission: always
```

## 🤝 Git Standards
Capybara is trained to be a good team player. All commits generated by the agent are signed:
