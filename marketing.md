# Capybara Vibe Coding - Landing Page Content

> **Note to Frontend Team:** This page should feel premium, developer-focused, and "hacker-chic". Think dark mode, neon accents (purple/amber/green), and smooth framer-motion animations. The "Vibe" is about flow state—coding without friction.

## 1. Hero Section

**Headline:**
**Code at the Speed of Thought.**

**Subheadline:**
The AI-powered CLI agent that thinks, plans, and acts in real-time. Stop wrestling with chat windows—manage your entire dev workflow from the terminal, with a "mission control" interface that keeps you in the driver's seat.

**Hero Visual:**
*A stylized terminal window split in half. Left side shows a glowing Todo list checking off items. Right side shows streaming code execution and tool outputs in real-time. The text "Capybara Vibe" pulses softly in the header.*

**Primary CTA:**
`pip install -e .` (Copy to Clipboard)

**Secondary CTA:**
[Watch the Demo]

## 2. The "Vibe" Difference (Value Prop)

**Tagline:**
**Not Just Another Chatbot. A Co-Pilot.**

**Copy:**
Most AI tools require you to context-switch, copy-paste, and baby-sit. Capybara lives in your terminal, understands your repo, and executes complex plans autonomously—while keeping you fully informed.

*   **Immersive Split-View:** See the **Strategy** (Left Panel) and **Tactics** (Right Panel) simultaneously. No black boxes.
*   **Context Aware:** It reads your `README`, scans your file tree, and respects your `.gitignore` from second zero.
*   **Safety First:** Runs in `Safe Mode` by default. You approve critical actions. No accidental `rm -rf /`.

## 3. Product Features (Grid Layout)

### 🖥️ Mission Control UI
Don't just watch text stream. Watch a **Plan** unfold. The persistent split-view keeps the big picture visible while the agent dives deep into the details.

### 🧠 Autonomous Planning
Capybara doesn't just guess. It creates a dynamic **Todo List** that evolves. It breaks tasks down, tracks progress, and self-corrects when it hits a wall.

### 🛡️ Guardrails & Safety
Review every file edit before it happens. Or switch to **Autonomous Mode** for trusted tasks. Your code, your rules.

### 🤝 Multi-Agent Squads
Need to research a library while refactoring? Capybara spawns **Child Agents** to handle parallel tasks without polluting your main context.

## 4. How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1.  **Initialize**
    `capybara init`
    *Sets up your secure configuration and learns your environment.*

2.  **Prompt**
    `capybara chat` -> "Refactor the auth module to use JWTs."
    *Just talk naturally. Capybara parses your intent.*

3.  **Watch It Think**
    *The agent drafts a plan, creates a Todo list, and starts executing edits file-by-file.*

4.  **Collaborate**
    *Interrupt, refine, or approve changes on the fly. You're always in control.*

## 5. Technical Specs (For the Nerds)

*   **Models:** Supports GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and local LLMs.
*   **Shell Integration:** Native Zsh/Bash/PowerShell support.
*   **Smart Editing:** Uses AST-aware search & replace (no hallucinated line numbers).
*   **Git Integration:** Auto-signs commits: `Co-authored-by: Capybara Vibe`.
