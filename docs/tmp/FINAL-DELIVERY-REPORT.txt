Objective: Visual representation of parent↔child agent interaction

Deliverables:
1. ✅ AgentStatus tracking system
   - 6-state lifecycle enum (IDLE, THINKING, EXECUTING_TOOLS, WAITING_FOR_CHILD,
     COMPLETED, FAILED)

   - Rich-based visual parent↔child interaction tree
   - Emoji state indicators (🤔, ⚙️, ⏳, ✅, ❌, 💤)
   - Color-coded states with box styling
   - Hierarchical agent display

3. ✅ EventBus Extensions
   - 4 new EventType values added (AGENT_STATE_CHANGE, DELEGATION_START,
     DELEGATION_COMPLETE, CHILD_RESPONSE)
   - 2 new Event fields (agent_state, message)
   - Fully backward compatible

4. ✅ Agent Integration
   - Status tracking in agent loop
   - Flow renderer creation (parent agents only)
   - State transitions throughout execution
   - Real-time parent↔child visualization

5. ✅ Test Coverage
